# EC2-Auto-Recovery-with-CloudWatch-Alarms
This project demonstrates how to create a CloudWatch alarm that automatically recovers an EC2 instance when it becomes impaired due to a system-level failure (e.g., hardware issues, underlying hypervisor problems).  This is crucial for DevOps, SysOps, and FinOps workflows that require maximum uptime and self-healing systems.
